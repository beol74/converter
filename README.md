# converter

This project contains source code and supporting files for constructing eagle.io converters. A `converter` provides a method to transform files acquired by eagle.io prior to ingestion; this allows greater flexibility to handle formats not compatible with the built-in platform visual parsing tools.

Once your `converter` has been submitted and approved, your format will be visible in the Data Source wizard.
